SECURITY AUDIT REPORT - DEMANDIFY MEDIA
========================================
Generated: October 10, 2025
Status: MULTIPLE CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FOUND


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================

This security assessment of the Demandify Media Next.js application revealed 23 significant vulnerabilities ranging from critical to low severity. The application currently lacks fundamental security controls including authentication, input validation, CSRF protection, and secure headers. Immediate remediation is required before production deployment.


CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES
========================

1. MISSING AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION
   Severity: CRITICAL
   Location: Entire application, specifically /studio route
   
   Description:
   The Sanity Studio CMS is publicly accessible at /studio route without any authentication layer. Any user can potentially access the content management system. No authentication mechanism exists for the admin panel.
   
   Evidence:
   - File: src/app/studio/page.tsx
   - No authentication wrapper or middleware detected
   - Sanity Studio exposed at public route
   
   Impact:
   - Unauthorized access to CMS
   - Content manipulation by attackers
   - Data breach of blog posts and user information
   - Complete site defacement possible
   
   Remediation:
   - Implement authentication middleware for /studio routes
   - Use NextAuth.js or similar for session management
   - Add role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Implement IP whitelisting for admin access
   - Enable Sanity Studio authentication


2. FORM SUBMISSION WITHOUT VALIDATION OR BACKEND PROCESSING
   Severity: CRITICAL
   Location: Contact forms and career application forms
   
   Description:
   All forms on the site are non-functional or lack server-side validation. The contact form at /contact-us has no form action, and the careers form only shows an alert. No backend API routes exist to handle submissions.
   
   Evidence:
   - File: src/app/contact-us/page.tsx (lines 42-119)
   - File: components/ui/ui/ApplyForm.tsx (lines 10-14)
   - Contact form button type is "button" not "submit"
   - Career form prevents default and shows alert only
   - No API routes in /app/api directory
   
   Impact:
   - Forms can be abused for spam
   - No data validation allows malicious input
   - File uploads not processed securely
   - Business loses all form submissions
   - No lead generation despite being core business
   
   Remediation:
   - Create API routes for form submissions
   - Implement server-side validation using zod or yup
   - Add rate limiting to prevent spam
   - Implement file upload validation and virus scanning
   - Store submissions in database with encryption
   - Add email notification system


3. CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS) VULNERABILITIES
   Severity: CRITICAL
   Location: Multiple components using dangerouslySetInnerHTML
   
   Description:
   The application uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML in multiple locations without sanitization. User-generated content from Sanity CMS could contain malicious scripts.
   
   Evidence:
   - File: src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (line 77)
   - File: components/ui/ui/craft.tsx (lines 42, 154, 158)
   - File: components/ui/spotlight-card.tsx (line 164)
   - JSON-LD structured data directly injected without validation
   
   Impact:
   - Stored XSS attacks through blog content
   - Session hijacking via cookie theft
   - Credential harvesting through fake forms
   - Malware distribution to site visitors
   - Complete account takeover possible
   
   Remediation:
   - Use DOMPurify library to sanitize all HTML
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Validate and escape JSON-LD data
   - Use React's built-in escaping for user content
   - Regular security scanning of CMS content


4. MISSING CSRF PROTECTION
   Severity: CRITICAL
   Location: All form submissions
   
   Description:
   No Cross-Site Request Forgery tokens implemented. Forms lack CSRF protection allowing attackers to forge requests from authenticated users.
   
   Evidence:
   - No CSRF token generation found
   - No middleware for CSRF validation
   - Forms lack hidden token fields
   
   Impact:
   - Attackers can perform actions on behalf of users
   - Unauthorized form submissions
   - Data manipulation through forged requests
   - Account modifications without consent
   
   Remediation:
   - Implement CSRF tokens using csurf package
   - Add token validation middleware
   - Include CSRF tokens in all forms
   - Use SameSite cookie attribute


HIGH SEVERITY VULNERABILITIES
==============================

5. INSECURE FILE UPLOAD FUNCTIONALITY
   Severity: HIGH

   Description:
   File upload accepts PDF files but has no backend validation, size limits are only client-side, and no virus scanning implemented.
   
   Evidence:
   - File: components/ui/ui/ApplyForm.tsx (lines 52-58)
   - Client-side only validation: accept="application/pdf"
   - Comment states "This demo form does not upload files"
   - No file type verification on server
   - No malware scanning
   
   Impact:
   - Malicious file uploads (malware, ransomware)

TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS
=======================

Required Security Tests:
1. Penetration testing by third party
2. OWASP ZAP automated scanning
3. Burp Suite manual testing
4. SQL injection testing (when DB added)
5. XSS payload testing
6. CSRF token bypass attempts
7. Authentication bypass testing
8. File upload vulnerability testing
9. Rate limit effectiveness testing
10. Session management testing


TOOLS FOR SECURITY IMPROVEMENT
===============================

Recommended Tools:
- npm audit / Snyk for dependency scanning
- ESLint security plugins
- SonarQube for code quality
- OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning
- Helmet.js for security headers
- Express Rate Limit for DoS protection
- DOMPurify for XSS prevention
- bcrypt for password hashing
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for auth
- Winston for security logging


CONCLUSION
==========

The Demandify Media application has significant security vulnerabilities that must be addressed before production deployment. The lack of authentication on the CMS, combined with XSS vulnerabilities and missing security controls, creates a critical risk profile.

Risk Level: CRITICAL
Recommendation: DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION without addressing at least all Critical and High severity vulnerabilities.

Total Vulnerabilities: 23
- Critical: 4
- High: 5
- Medium: 7
- Low: 5
- Informational: 2

Estimated Remediation Time: 4-6 weeks for full security implementation

This audit should be treated as a starting point. Regular security assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews are essential for maintaining security posture.
